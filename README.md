- 👋 Hi, I’m @MatinAi-root
  👀 I’m interested in backend languages, server-side work, and data center-level operations.
  I’m also passionate about cybersecurity and want to deepen my knowledge in Linux, data structures, and algorithm design.
  Front-end is great too, but it’s my last priority.
  I just like to learn many things.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning advanced PHP and will soon start with Laravel. Due to university projects and coursework, I’ve also worked with other languages.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects based on PHP, but I’m also open to adapting to other languages.
- 📫 How to reach me will be updated soon 😁.
- 😄 Pronouns: You can call me "Root", "ByteForge", or "Obito", "Matin" works too.
- ⚡ Fun fact: Well IDK... . Being an INTJ Vampire counts?
